## Nginx Application

1. Here I have added the code to deploy an Nginx application using Terraform.
2. Also, it will deploy EFK [ElasticSearch, Fluentbit and Kibana] to a local kubernetes cluster.
3. This terraform repo will deploy Prometheus and Grafana deployment as well.

Also, I have modified some helm chart where my nginx is working properly along with EFK and Grafana-Prom chart. Added the helm charts to this repo as well.
